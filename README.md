# CGBA-potentials
A repository for bond angle potentials for publication

The repository contains 5 CG models trained with different KDE bandwidth, each model has a pair potential and a bond_angle (BA) potential, listed in individual files. 
The file name contains the information what potential it is and what bandwidth it was trained with.
e.g. pair.table.EEE.w1x means this is the pair potential for the w1x model

Potentials from different models should not be used together.
